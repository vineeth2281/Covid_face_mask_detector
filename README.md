# Covid_face_mask_detector using CNN, Mobile_Net  and  Tensor flow

## Dependencies :
Python 3.7

Keras 2.2.4 conda install keras=2.2.4

Tensorflow 1.15 conda install tensorflow-gpu=1.15 or conda install tensorflow

OpenCV-python

ImageDataGEnrator

NumPy

OS

MobileNetV2

## Dataset :

I have created the dataset for this project and i have divided it into divided into two categories ie "img_mask" and "img_nomask" and stored into RESORCE folder.

I downloaded the images for both categories from internet and saved them in respective folder in the system.

Totally I have 4541 images beacuse we need to get highly accurate model..

img_mask = 2605

img_nomask = 1936

## Pre-requsite:

All the dependencies and required libraries are included in the file requirements.txt

## Features.

My face mask detector didn't uses any morphed masked images dataset.

The model is accurate, and since we used the MobileNetV2 architecture, 

itâ€™s also efficient and thus making it easier to deploy the model 

Model accuracy is 0.99
